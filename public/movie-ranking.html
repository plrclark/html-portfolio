<h1>My All-Time Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>The best movies ever!</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Casablanca</h3>
<p>Romance, but not your typical storyline romance.<br> 
Best quote ever comes from this movie.</p>

<h3>Empire Records</h3>
<p>Stupid, funny, and random, making it perfect to watch over and over.</p>

<h3>Serenity</h3>
<p>I just love the Firefly series and wish it hadn't been canceled.</p>
