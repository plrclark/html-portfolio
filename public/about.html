<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Penny Clark. I'm a marketing specialist with a strong background in content management and marketing analytics. 
  I am a reader, a writer, a researcher, and a learner. I am always looking to increase and improve my skills. 
</p>

<p>I am currently branching out to data analytics. I have a Google certification in Data Analytics and am working on an advanced 
  certification in this area. Beyond data, I'm also learning more about project and product management, web development, and UX design.
